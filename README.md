# List of expenses
- All tasks finished
- Sorting via clicking on headers
- Code made with an idea to easily extend functionality and to integrate with some server
- There is no form over changing euro rate, it is supposed to be quick and simple "click to change" (Accepts only positive numbers)
- As I do not have extend knowledge of Mobx, some parts of code might differ to the state of the art

## Libraries:
### Vite
I used Vite because it is a fast and efficient boiler plate, if the project was to be bigger I would use NextJS.
### Chakra UI
As a UI library I used Chakra UI - Due to the fact that it has the components required to create an application, the simplicity, lightness of the library
### Yup and react-hook-form
Yup and React Hook Form were used in the project for form validation and management. Yup provides a schema-based validation system, ensuring the submitted data meets specific criteria. React Hook Form simplifies form handling using React hooks, improving performance and reducing boilerplate code. Together, they enable robust and efficient form development with client-side validation.
